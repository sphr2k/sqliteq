# sqliteq

Durable message queue over SQLite, in TypeScript.

Inspired by [goqite](https://github.com/maragudk/goqite). Zero dependencies.

## Install

```
bun add @minnzen/sqliteq better-sqlite3
```

sqliteq uses an adapter pattern to support different SQLite backends with a unified asynchronous API.

## Usage

### 1. Choose a Driver

| Runtime | Backend | Driver |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | better-sqlite3 | `BetterSqlite3Driver` |
| Bun | bun:sqlite | `BunSqliteDriver` |
| Remote/Distributed | LibSQL / Turso | `LibsqlDriver` |

### 2. Implementation

```ts
import { Queue, BetterSqlite3Driver } from '@minnzen/sqliteq'
import Database from 'better-sqlite3'

const db = new Database('app.db')
const q = new Queue(new BetterSqlite3Driver(db), 'emails')

// Initialize schema (first time only)
await q.init()

await q.send({ to: 'user@example.com', subject: 'Hello' })

const msg = await q.receive()
if (msg) {
  console.log(msg.body)
  await q.delete(msg.id, msg.received)
}
```

### Turso / LibSQL

```ts
import { createClient } from '@libsql/client'
import { Queue, LibsqlDriver } from '@minnzen/sqliteq'

const client = createClient({ url: 'libsql://...', authToken: '...' })
const q = new Queue(new LibsqlDriver(client), 'jobs')

await q.init()
await q.send({ task: 'process' })
```

The `Queue` class is now fully asynchronous for all backends, ensuring a
consistent interface whether you're using a local file or a remote Turso DB.

## Features

- Single `sqliteq` table holds all queues -- no migrations per queue
- Atomic receive via `UPDATE ... WHERE id = (SELECT ...)` -- no advisory locks
- Visibility timeout with automatic redelivery on failure
- Priority queues (higher priority messages are received first)
- Delayed messages
- Batch send in a single transaction
- Batch receive
- Dead letter detection (messages exceeding max receive count)
- Queue stats (ready / delayed / in-flight / dead)
- Dead letter requeue and purge operations
- Typed messages with generics (`Queue<T>`)
- Bring your own SQLite driver -- tested with better-sqlite3 and bun:sqlite

## API

### `new Queue<T>(db, name, options?)`

Create or connect to a named queue. Schema is created if it does not exist.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `timeout` | `number` | `5000` | Visibility timeout in ms |
| `maxReceive` | `number` | `3` | Max receives before dead-lettering |
| `maxBodyBytes` | `number` | `1048576` | Max body size in bytes after JSON serialization |

The `db` parameter accepts any object matching the `Database` interface
(a subset of better-sqlite3 and bun:sqlite):

```ts
interface Database {
  prepare(sql: string): Statement
  exec(sql: string): void
  transaction<R>(fn: (...args: unknown[]) => R): (...args: unknown[]) => R
}
```

### `queue.send(body: T, options?): string`

Send a message. Returns the message ID.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `delay` | `number` | `0` | Delivery delay in ms |
| `priority` | `number` | `0` | Higher values are received first |

### `queue.sendBatch(messages): string[]`

Send multiple messages in one transaction. Each entry is
`{ body: T, options?: SendOptions }`. Returns an array of IDs.

### `queue.receive(): Message<T> | null`

Claim the next available message. Returns `null` when the queue is empty or
all messages are in-flight. The message becomes invisible to other consumers
for `timeout` ms.

```ts
interface Message<T> {
  id: string
  body: T
  received: number  // receive count (1 on first delivery)
}
```

### `queue.receiveBatch(limit): Message<T>[]`

Atomically claim up to `limit` available messages. Returns fewer than requested
when the queue runs dry. Claimed messages follow the same visibility timeout
and fencing semantics as `receive()`.

### `queue.extend(id, received, delay): boolean`

Extend a message's visibility timeout by `delay` ms. Returns `false` if the
message was already redelivered to another consumer (stale handle).

### `queue.delete(id, received): boolean`

Acknowledge and remove a message. Returns `false` on stale handle (safe no-op).

### `queue.size(): number`

Total messages in the queue (all states).

### `queue.stats(): QueueStats`

Get queue counts grouped by state:

```ts
interface QueueStats {
  total: number
  ready: number
  delayed: number
  inFlight: number
  dead: number
}
```

### `queue.purge(): number`

Delete all messages. Returns the count removed.

### `queue.deadLetters(): Message<T>[]`

Get messages that exceeded `maxReceive`. These will never be delivered again
and should be inspected or moved.

### `queue.requeueDeadLetters(options?): string[]`

Requeue all current dead letters as fresh messages and return their new IDs.
Requeued messages preserve body and priority, optionally apply a new delay, and
always get new IDs so stale handles from previous deliveries stay invalid.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `delay` | `number` | `0` | Delay in ms before requeued messages become visible |

### `queue.purgeDeadLetters(): number`

Delete all current dead letters. Returns the count removed.

### `new Processor<T>(queue, options)`

Long-running consumer that polls, processes, and auto-deletes messages.

```ts
import { Queue, Processor } from '@minnzen/sqliteq'

const q = new Queue(db, 'jobs')
const p = new Processor(q, {
  handler(msg) {
    console.log('processing', msg.body)
    // return normally = auto-delete
    // throw = leave for retry after timeout
  },
  pollInterval: 200,
  concurrency: 4,
})

p.start()
// later:
await p.stop() // waits for in-flight handlers to finish
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `handler` | `(msg) => void \| Promise<void>` | required | Message handler |
| `pollInterval` | `number` | `100` | Poll interval in ms |
| `concurrency` | `number` | `1` | Max simultaneous handlers |
| `extendInterval` | `number` | queue timeout | Auto-extend period; `0` to disable |
| `onError` | `(error, context) => void` | `console.error` | Error callback |

The processor auto-extends visibility at 4/5 of the extend interval so
long-running handlers don't lose their message. Note: auto-extend relies
on `setInterval`, so handlers must yield the event loop (use `async`/`await`).
CPU-bound synchronous handlers will block the timer and may cause
unintended redelivery.

## Benchmarks

On a MacBook Pro M-series, with better-sqlite3, file-backed database:

| Operation | Throughput | Latency |
|---|---|---|
| send + receive + delete | ~20,000 ops/sec | 49 us/op |
| send only | ~31,000 ops/sec | -- |
| receive + delete (100K row table, 10 queues) | ~18,000 ops/sec | 55 us/op |
| sendBatch (100 msgs/transaction) | ~120,000 ops/sec | -- |

Run `npx tsx bench/run.ts` to reproduce.

## Design

Messages live in a single `sqliteq` table shared across all queues.
Each message has a `timeout` timestamp; receiving a message atomically
bumps that timestamp forward, making the message invisible. If the consumer
crashes or fails to delete the message, it becomes visible again after the
timeout expires. After `maxReceive` deliveries, the message is dead-lettered.

This is the same model as SQS and goqite, adapted for synchronous SQLite.

Delivery guarantee is **at-least-once**. Handlers must be idempotent because
a message can be delivered more than once if the previous consumer times out.
